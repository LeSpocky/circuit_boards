The [Trinket](http://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-trinket) by adafruit
is an awesome small board based on an Atmel ATtiny85 microcontroller.
Although just a little less than 8$ or 8â‚¬ we made a clone for ourselves
which is not that small but a single layer PCB design for easy
manufacturing in your local hackerspace, of course 100% compatible on
the electrical side. You can use all the software, tutorials and so on.
The parts are easily available in Europe or just right already there in
your part storage.
